# 🐍 Turtle Polygon & Firework Animation Project

This project contains two Python programs created for our Coding Is Fun course:

1. **Regular Polygon Drawer** – a program that draws any regular polygon based on user input.
2. **Firework Arc Animation** – a turtle animation simulating a ball following an arc and landing on a firework tube.

## 📌 1. Regular Polygon Program

### ✔ Features
- User inputs:
  - Number of sides
  - Length of each side
- Uses a loop to draw all sides
- Calculates the correct turning angle using:
  \[
  \text{turn angle} = 180 - \frac{(sides - 2) \times 180}{sides}
  \]

### ▶ How to Run
```bash
python polygon.py
